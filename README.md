# HTML-CSS-JavaScript
Projects/assignments developed for Web Interface Design and Client-Side Web Development courses at Centennial College (2022-2023)

Web Interface Design (2022) offered an introduction to developing in HTML and CSS, and Client-Side Web Development (2023) introduced JavaScript to the web development process. Each project folder has a PDF copy of the assignment description and all the files submitted. All of the web pages from Web Interface Design are deployed on Centennial College's student site at: http://studentweb.cencol.ca/yadem3/ with hyperlinks on the homepage to each project. Client-Side Web Development projects are also deployed on the student site on separate pages indicated on each project's README.md file.
