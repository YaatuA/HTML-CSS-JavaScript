    <div class="intro">
        <p>A protected area is a recognized and defined geographical area that is intentionally protected and managed to conserve nature in the long term. One third of all land is degrading or already degraded due to human activity, so protected areas offer a solution to safeguard essential ecosystems. Areas are protected for various reasons, such as to conserve biodiversity and protecting endangered species by protecting their native habitats. They are able to serve local communities by shielding neighbourhoods and cities from natural disasters, and can even boost economies through tourism and recreation. </p>
